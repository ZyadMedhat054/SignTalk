Deaf and hearing - impaired people face many challenges and problems in their daily lives . They suffer from difficulty communicating with people who do not master sign language . It is difficult for them to exchange thoughts , feelings , and daily needs . They may feel isolated and cut off from society . This social isolation can negatively affect mental health . And emotional to them . Therefore , the idea of our project is to create a mobile application that is a silent conversation to learn sign language for individuals who suffer from deafness or hearing loss , to bridge the communication gap between the deaf community and the hearing world by enabling simultaneous translation of sign language gestures using all algorithms and computer vision techniques .
